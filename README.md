# TE-PS_0024

Testing for my firtst Github training

## Licence
Licence chosen is GNU GPL v3, see Licence file on the same github
The author of this git is the github user 3nrique0, contact him for details if required.

## Create the git

I used a repertory that has already some files from a small pipeline for my PhD.


This is how it works on local, once you've created your Git on the github website

	echo "# TE-PS_0024" >> README.md
	git init
	git add *
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git remote add origin https://github.com/3nrique0/TE-PS_0024.git
	git push -u origin master

Normally the first thing to add is `git add README.md`. I used instead a `git add *`.
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Testing how to commit only one file

Test added 2 files changed, only 1 to be commited.
Only the files that have been committed will be pushed
